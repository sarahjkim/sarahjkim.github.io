                I have visited Seattle three times - twice with my brother and once during a college Spring Break trip. Each time, it consistently rained. (I have not yet gone during the summer.)
                My friend who grew up in Portland told me that you can tell a tourist from a local because the locals don't use umbrellas. I tried to coexist with the rain in this way and, for the most part, didn't mind it. Seattle is an incredibly lush and fresh-smelling city, and I credit the rain for this.

                A couple friends and I went to Japan for two and a half weeks (May 24 - June 9, 2016) after graduating from university. We visited Tokyo (6 days), Gujo-Hachiman in Gifu Prefecture (3 days), Kyoto (4 days), and Osaka (2 days). I wanted to document my favorite parts of the trip. (All pictures were taken by me.) I know this post is long overdue, but I suppose now is better than never!

                A week or so ago, we released the mid-semester survey to students. We received responses from 421 students in the course (46 for my sections in particular). I wanted to go over the responses in class and respond to interesting things, but I realized that would take too much time. So here's a post instead!

                I haven't written in quite a while because I've been busy this past summer teaching for CS 61BL (Data Structures & Programming Methodology in Java) at UC Berkeley. Now that the course has completed, I thought I'd share some arbitrarily chosen stories and reflections on my first semester as a TA. Hopefully, there will be a good mix of funny, informative, and thoughtful entries.

                The time has come once again for UC Berkeley's student government elections, and this season revives many of my feelings of frustration, helplessness, regret, and disillusionment. When I read the campaign platforms of the next cycle of student representatives, I see trite phrases and empty promises. I do not see fire. I do not see purpose. I do not see passion. I do not see great big dreams. And this scares me. This angers me. This depresses me. So I write. I write about what I would change if I could. I write to rant. I write to start a conversation. I write with the hope that perhaps someone less disillusioned can be motivated by my words.

                This post was largely motivated by Libby Rainey's Daily Californian article entitled "Breeding the Tech Elite." I have often had discussions with my fellow CS friends about the growing importance of technology, and a question we often ask ourselves is, "What can we as engineers do with our skills and knowledge to better society?"

Looking back, I am thankful for what I've learned, where I've come, and the world I've found. And I am so grateful to those who have helped me along the way. I thought I would make this introspective post to remind myself of this first year of CS.

                This is a guide to version control by a beginner for beginners. I first heard the words "version control" from my friend Soumya Basu a little less than a year ago. He had taken one look at my previous way of saving versions of my CS project and had just started laughing. I was a bit taken aback at first, then incredulous when he said there already existed systems to do what I had been doing. Now looking back, I am so thankful that he told me about version control when he did.

                Some Americans declare that Edward Snowden is "grandiose narcissist who deserves to be in prison." They state that Snowden's leaks did not demonstrate true violations but rather only exposed government policies that "failed to meet his own standards of propriety." I disagree with this view. Snowden is a whistleblower who did not simply dump information to hurt the United States, but rather revealed government abuses in such a way that the public is now able to propose changes and reviews that will lead to future transparency, morality, and reform.
