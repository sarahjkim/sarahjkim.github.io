    <div id="title">What I Would Change About UC Berkeley</div>
    <div id="date">Tuesday, April 8, 2014</div>
    <div id="text">
        The time has come once again for UC Berkeley's student government <a href="http://elections.asuc.org/"><u>elections</u></a>,
        and this season revives many of my feelings of anger, helplessness, regret, and
        disillusionment. When I read the campaign platforms of the next cycle of student
        representatives, I see trite phrases and empty promises. I see meaningless slogans
        and timid suggestions. I do not see fire. I do not see purpose. I do not see passion.
        I do not see great big dreams. And this scares me. This angers me. This depresses me.
    </div>
    <div id="text">
        So what do I do? I write. I write about what I would change if I could. I write to
        rant. I write to start a conversation. I write with the hope that perhaps someone
        less disillusioned can be motivated by my words. I should warn my readers that my
        unguarded feelings may be controversial. I think, however, that my thoughts only echo
        many of emotions felt by my fellow students - frustrated about bureaucracy, helplessness
        in the face of an organization hampered by traditions and inefficiency, regret about
        our own lack of involvement, and mostly disillusionment. Disillusionment about the
        student government that more than likely stems from disillusionment with our own
        nation's government and politics in general. The following are just a couple of
        ideas about how the student experience could be improved that I hope will begin
        a much-needed conversation.
    </div>
    <div class="segment">1. Get rid of unproductive bureaucracy and upgrade technology.</div>
    <div id="text">
        Honestly, I don't understand why there is so much bureaucracy. Why are there so many
        forms to fill out, permits to file, grants to write, and trainings to attend for
        things like event registrations? Events already require so much planning and effort
        to run successfully. Why are there are so many things that hinder their success?
        Is it all necessary? I really don't think so.
    </div>
    <div id="text">
        Berkeley is one of the technologically leading institutions in the world. Many essential
        services should be automated so that there is less paperwork and bureaucracy for both
        those who file paperwork and those who must deal with it. In particular, I think two
        large segments of campus services need to be restructured.
    </div>
    <div id="text">
        The <a href="http://lead.berkeley.edu/"><u>ASUC LEAD center</u></a> is responsible for
        leadership development on campus in practical areas such as event planning and organizational
        management, funding, and University relations. If you are a student group leader,
        this basically means that the LEAD center is how you process most of your financial
        transactions. If you are a student leader for an organization that deals with money
        each semester, then the LEAD center in practice translates to a big headache and a
        pressure point for student leaders on campus.
    </div>
    <div id="text">
        Processes such as training signatories, using your own organization's funds, receiving
        reimbursements, and processing invoices take large amounts of paperwork and require
        dedicated time from student leaders who usually have much better ways to use their
        time. Furthermore, every process is exceedingly slow and often hurts students. For
        example, student leaders must often pay for events from their own pockets then wait
        weeks (even months at times) for reimbursements.
    </div>
    <div id="text">
        Let me compare this to the modern conveniences of using bank account credit cards
        or payment systems through companies like Square, PayPal, or Stripe. Is it too much
        to ask to for student organizations to be issued cards to more easily draw funds from
        their own accounts? Is it too much to ask for ways to file paperwork online?
        Is it too much to ask at the very least that students receive their reimbursements
        in less than two weeks?
    </div>
    <div id="text">
        Another large pain point on campus is the <a href="https://or.berkeley.edu/StGroupRequests/"><u>room reservation process</u></a>.
        Thankfully, most of my experiences with room reservations have been relatively painless
        thanks to the wonderful EECS department staff that manage <a href="http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Resguide/roomsched.shtml"><u>Soda & Cory Hall reservations</u></a>.
        However, I feel for other student groups without ties to the EECS department that must
        use the reservation request format for the rest of campus.
    </div>
    <div id="text">
        I have only had one experience with trying to reserve a non-Soda room, and it was
        a terrible, unsuccessful experience. It was impossible to send a request far in advance
        of the event happening, and our request was denied. My student organization ended up
        going back to a Soda room (which was smaller than what was need for our intents and
        purposes but far more readily available). For context, the event was an educational
        workshop teaching front-end web design to interested students. Surely there is a way
        to use more advanced scheduling software to optimize on-campus spaces for productive
        and interesting activities.
    </div>
    <div class="segment">2. Being an ASUC intern should be a meaningful experience, and elected
    officials should be held accountable for promised projects.</div>
    <div id="text">
        This next segment may hit closer to home. I know it does for me. My freshman year,
        I <a href="http://asuc.org/intern/"><u>interned</u></a> for an ASUC senator who is
        no longer involved in the student government after an unsuccessful re-election campaign.
        I honestly must say it was one of the most useless and unfulfilling of my obligations
        that year. I applied and entered the intern program with naive optimism that I would be
        working on interesting projects that would benefit the student body. I was excited
        to work for the university I already loved and was looking forward to be an engaged
        and active student.
    </div>
    <div id="text">
        The reality was from this. I felt that most of what happened was all talk and no action.
        I liked many of my senator's platforms. However, nothing progressed with them. We
        met for strategy meetings that were just reiterations of proposed ideas with no
        actual assignments or progress made. Every attempt I made to get started on projects
        was impeded by lack of clear guidance or task assignment. Rather, I feel that my
        particular senator was mostly motivated by the need to be re-elected rather than
        the need to fulfill the promises he made during his first campaign.
    </div>
    <div id="text">
        Perhaps not all interns had the same experience as I did. But I do know that I am
        not alone in my feeling of uselessness and disillusionment. No intern should feel
        what I felt. Interns should learn practical skills on their job and gain experience
        working on projects. Interns should feel that their senators work hard to make good
        on their election platform projects. Interns should see an end product that they
        can feel pride in having contributed to. The intern program should restructured
        and guided so that every intern feels that they have had a productive experience.
    </div>
    <div id="text">
        Senators and other ASUC officials should be held accountable by those who voted for
        them. Status reports should be clear, readable, and readily accessible online.
        ASUC projects should be transparent to students and frequently updated. Senators should
        be able to claim projects as their work. Most people feel more motivated if their
        work is under inspection and review. This is no doubt true for elected officials.
    </div>
    <div class="segment">3. Bring influential speakers and artists to campus.</div>
    <div id="text">
        There are many incredible people from whom Berkeley students can learn by observation
        and listening. There should be more officially sponsored events to hear professors
        speak on their topics of expertise and to bring in speakers from other areas. I am
        thankful for <a href="http://forum.berkeley.edu/"><u>Berkeley Forum</u></a>, which
        was formed for this exact purpose. These efforts should be encouraged and supported
        officially, especially financially, as these events provide a direct service to
        undergraduates in facilitating intellectual and political discussion and should
        continue to remain free for all students.
    </div>
    <div id="text">
        Art - whether it be fine art, music, or other art areas - is another aspect that
        should be encouraged. Currently there are very few free concerts for Berkeley students,
        and "mainstream" artists have very rarely come to campus. Compare this to UCSD, which
        hosts the <a href="http://sungodfestival.ucsd.edu/"><u>Sun God Festival</u></a> every
        year, and Cornell, which brings artists to campus every <a href="http://slopeday.cornell.edu/"><u>Slope Day</u></a>.
        Berkeley has no such prominent event that promotes music and campus bonding, and this
        absence is felt by many students.
    </div>
    <div id="text">
        Furthermore, other art forms should also be more accessible to students. The Berkeley-affiliated
        <a href="http://www.calperfs.berkeley.edu/"><u>Cal Performances</u></a> does bring many
        wonderful music, dance, and theater performances to campus, but these are often expensive.
        I have had the opportunity to view both the Chinese National Circus and Yo-Yo Ma
        at Zellerbach Hall, but ticket prices are often prohibitively expensive for most Cal
        students. For example, I paid nearly $50 for a seat at the Yo-Yo Ma concert in one of
        the last rows of the second level of Zellerbach, and the ticket had already been discounted
        by 50% because I was a Cal student. Furthermore, no tickets are reserved for Cal
        students, so they often quickly sell out to campus outsiders, thus exacerbating
        the problem of accessibility to students. I purchased the aforementioned coveted
        ticket several months in advance of the concert date because it sold out before most
        Berkeley students even knew about the performance.
    </div>
    <div class="segment">4. Improve online portals for campus services.</div>
    <div id="text">
        I am very thankful for the proposed evaluations and changes to essential <a href="https://ets.berkeley.edu/rae"><u>online portals</u></a>.
        I hope that improvements come naturally and quickly as much needs to be changed to
        existing systems. However, I have not seen any work scheduled for Callisto, which is
        the primary job portal for Berkeley students. There is little quality control for
        job postings, and its interface is outdated and difficult to navigate/search. A complete
        overhaul of the site might be a very good idea (and in my opinion doesn't seem to be
        all to difficult to complete in a reasonable timeline).
    </div>
    <div id="text">
        Another larger problem is the myriad of unorganized and uncollected different sites
        for campus job postings and research positions. Campus jobs are posted sometimes in
        their individual sites (like the <a href="https://ets.berkeley.edu/student-jobs"><u>ETS site</u></a>)
        and sometimes in Callisto. Even more convoluted is research position listings.
        Individual labs might make postings, departments might have lists of positions, and
        many labs/professors announce openings through the <a href="http://research.berkeley.edu/urap/"><u>URAP program</u></a>.
        For example, computer science positions are located on the URAP site, the
        <a href="http://researchmatch.herokuapp.com/"><u>College of Engineering clearing house</u></a>,
        and individual professor/research lab websites. 
    </div>
    <div id="text">
        This makes it difficult to for students to search for appropriate and interesting
        positions and also limits the number of applications that professors receive.
        A cohesive site that faculty members are encouraged to use or perhaps even one that
        scrapes postings from other sites and redirects students may be extremely helpful
        to all parties involved.
    </div>
    <div class="segment">5. There are many other possibilities for improvement.</div>
    <div id="text">
        There are also numerous other possibilities that would make this post far longer
        than it is now. One such idea is the argument that student organizations should be
        allowed and even encouraged to achieve non-profit status and to hold their funds in
        non-ASUC accounts. Inter-major events should also be encouraged, especially as very few
        academic organizations are broad and encompass many different fields (such as humanities
        and sciences). Perhaps more events like <a href="http://digitalhumanities.berkeley.edu/fsm-archive-hackathon"><u>HackFSM</u></a>,
        which brought together computer scientists and humanities majors to improve ways
        of conducting humanities research, would be beneficial in uniting students in different
        fields of study.
    </div>
    <div id="text">
        There are so many different wonderful ideas that it might be a good idea to invest
        in forums for students to propose and discuss ideas and solutions like <a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/"><u>Meta StackOverflow</u></a>,
        a forum to discuss improvements to the forum StackOverflow. In the end, more discussion
        and space to propose ideas may be very healthy and beneficial for our campus.
    </div>
    <div id="text">
        In conclusion, I do feel frustrated, helpless, regretful, and disillusioned. Yet at the
        same time, I feel love and hope towards UC Berkeley and towards my fellow students.
        I have honestly truly enjoyed and appreciated my time at Cal thus far, and my
        discontent ultimately stems from my firm and unchanging belief that we can do better -
        that Berkeley students deserve more and that we are capable of making our school a
        better place.
