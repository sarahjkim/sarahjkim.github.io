        <div id="title">What I Would Change About UC Berkeley</div>
        <div id="date">Tuesday, April 8, 2014</div>
        <div class="text">
            The time has come once again for UC Berkeley's student government <a href="http://elections.asuc.org/"><u>elections</u></a>,
            and this season revives many of my feelings of frustration, helplessness, regret, and
            disillusionment. When I read the campaign platforms of the next cycle of student
            representatives, I see trite phrases and empty promises. I see meaningless slogans
            and timid suggestions. I do not see fire. I do not see purpose. I do not see passion.
            I do not see great big dreams. And this scares me. This angers me. This depresses me.
        </div>
        <div class="text">
            So what do I do? I write. I write about what I would change if I could. I write to
            rant. I write to start a conversation. I write with the hope that perhaps someone
            less disillusioned can be motivated by my words. I should warn my readers that my
            unguarded feelings may be controversial. I think, however, that my thoughts only echo
            many of emotions felt by my fellow students - frustration about bureaucracy, helplessness
            in the face of an organization hampered by traditions and inefficiency, regret about
            our own lack of involvement, and mostly disillusionment. Disillusionment about the
            student government that more than likely stems from disillusionment with our own
            nation's government and politics in general. The following are just a couple of
            ideas about how the student experience could be improved that I hope will begin
            a much-needed conversation.
        </div>
        <div class="segment">1. Get rid of unproductive bureaucracy and upgrade technology.</div>
        <div class="text">
            Honestly, I don't understand why there is so much bureaucracy. Why are there so many
            forms to fill out, permits to file, grants to write, and trainings to attend for
            things like event registrations? Events already require so much planning and effort
            to run successfully. Why are there are so many things that hinder their success?
            Is it all necessary? I really don't think so.
        </div>
        <div class="text">
            Berkeley is one of the technologically leading institutions in the world. Many essential
            services should be automated so that there is less paperwork and bureaucracy for both
            those who file paperwork and those who must deal with it. In particular, I think two
            large segments of campus services need to be restructured.
        </div>
        <div class="text">
            The <a href="http://lead.berkeley.edu/"><u>ASUC LEAD center</u></a> is responsible for
            leadership development on campus in practical areas such as event planning and organizational
            management, funding, and University relations. If you are a student group leader,
            this basically means that the LEAD center is how you process most of your financial
            transactions. If you are a student leader for an organization that deals with money
            each semester, then the LEAD center in practice translates to a big headache and a
            pressure point for student leaders on campus.
        </div>
        <div class="text">
            Processes such as training signatories, using your own organization's funds, receiving
            reimbursements, and processing invoices take large amounts of paperwork and require
            dedicated time from student leaders who usually have much better ways to use their
            time. Furthermore, every process is exceedingly slow and often hurts students. For
            example, student leaders must often pay for events from their own pockets then wait
            weeks (even months at times) for reimbursements.
        </div>
        <div class="text">
            Let me compare this to the modern conveniences of using bank account credit cards
            or payment systems through companies like Square, PayPal, or Stripe. Is it too much
            to ask to for student organizations to be issued cards to more easily draw funds from
            their own accounts? Is it too much to ask for ways to file paperwork online?
            Is it too much to ask at the very least that students receive their reimbursements
            in less than two weeks?
        </div>
        <div class="text">
            Another large pain point on campus is the <a href="https://or.berkeley.edu/StGroupRequests/"><u>room reservation process</u></a>.
            Thankfully, most of my experiences with room reservations have been relatively painless
            thanks to the wonderful EECS department staff that manage <a href="http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Resguide/roomsched.shtml"><u>Soda & Cory Hall reservations</u></a>.
            However, I feel for other student groups without ties to the EECS department that must
            use the reservation request format for the rest of campus.
        </div>
        <div class="text">
            I have only had one experience with trying to reserve a non-Soda room, and it was
            a terrible, unsuccessful experience. It was impossible to send a request far in advance
            of the event happening, and our request was denied. My student organization ended up
            going back to a Soda room (which was smaller than what was need for our intents and
            purposes but far more readily available). For context, the event was an educational
            workshop teaching front-end web design to interested students. Surely there is a way
            to use more advanced scheduling software to optimize on-campus spaces for productive
            and interesting activities.
        </div>
        <div class="segment">2. Being an ASUC intern should be a meaningful experience, and elected
        officials should be held accountable for promised projects.</div>
        <div class="text">
            This next segment may hit closer to home. I know it does for me. My freshman year,
            I <a href="http://asuc.org/intern/"><u>interned</u></a> for an ASUC senator who is
            no longer involved in the student government after an unsuccessful re-election campaign.
            I honestly must say it was one of the most useless and unfulfilling of my obligations
            that year. I applied and entered the intern program with naive optimism that I would be
            working on interesting projects that would benefit the student body. I was excited
            to work for the university I already loved and was looking forward to be an engaged
            and active student.
        </div>
        <div class="text">
            The reality was from this. I felt that most of what happened was all talk and no action.
            I liked many of my senator's platforms. However, nothing progressed with them. We
            met for strategy meetings that were just reiterations of proposed ideas with no
            actual assignments or progress made. Every attempt I made to get started on projects
            was impeded by lack of clear guidance or task assignment. Rather, I feel that my
            particular senator was mostly motivated by the need to be re-elected rather than
            the need to fulfill the promises he made during his first campaign.
        </div>
        <div class="text">
            Perhaps not all interns had the same experience as I did. But I do know that I am
            not alone in my feeling of uselessness and disillusionment. No intern should feel
            what I felt. Interns should learn practical skills on their job and gain experience
            working on projects. Interns should feel that their senators work hard to make good
            on their election platform projects. Interns should see an end product that they
            can feel pride in having contributed to. The intern program should restructured
            and guided so that every intern feels that they have had a productive experience.
        </div>
        <div class="text">
            Senators and other ASUC officials should be held accountable by those who voted for
            them. Status reports should be clear, readable, and readily accessible online.
            ASUC projects should be transparent to students and frequently updated. Senators should
            be able to claim projects as their work. Most people feel more motivated if their
            work is under inspection and review. This is no doubt true for elected officials.
        </div>
        <div class="segment">3. Improve online portals for campus services.</div>
        <div class="text">
            I am very thankful for the proposed evaluations and changes to essential <a href="https://ets.berkeley.edu/rae"><u>online portals</u></a>.
            I hope that improvements come naturally and quickly as much needs to be changed to
            existing systems. However, I have not seen any work scheduled for Callisto, which is
            the primary job portal for Berkeley students. There is little quality control for
            job postings, and its interface is outdated and difficult to navigate/search. A complete
            overhaul of the site might be a very good idea (and in my opinion doesn't seem to be
            all to difficult to complete in a reasonable timeline).
        </div>
        <div class="text">
            Another larger problem is the myriad of unorganized and uncollected different sites
            for campus job postings and research positions. Campus jobs are posted sometimes in
            their individual sites (like the <a href="https://ets.berkeley.edu/student-jobs"><u>ETS site</u></a>)
            and sometimes in Callisto. Even more convoluted is research position listings.
            Individual labs might make postings, departments might have lists of positions, and
            many labs/professors announce openings through the <a href="http://research.berkeley.edu/urap/"><u>URAP program</u></a>.
            For example, computer science positions are located on the URAP site, the
            <a href="http://researchmatch.herokuapp.com/"><u>College of Engineering clearing house</u></a>,
            and individual professor/research lab websites. 
        </div>
        <div class="text">
            This makes it difficult to for students to search for appropriate and interesting
            positions and also limits the number of applications that professors receive.
            A cohesive site that faculty members are encouraged to use or perhaps even one that
            scrapes postings from other sites and redirects students may be extremely helpful
            to all parties involved.
        </div>
        <div class="segment">4. Bring influential speakers and artists to campus.</div>
        <div class="text">
            There are many incredible people from whom Berkeley students can learn by observation
            and listening. There should be more officially sponsored events to hear professors
            speak on their topics of expertise and to bring in speakers from other areas. I am
            thankful for <a href="http://forum.berkeley.edu/"><u>Berkeley Forum</u></a>, which
            was formed for this exact purpose. These efforts should be encouraged and supported
            officially, especially financially, as these events provide a direct service to
            undergraduates in facilitating intellectual and political discussion and should
            continue to remain free for all students.
        </div>
        <div class="text">
            Art - whether it be fine art, music, or other art areas - should be accessible to
            all students. The Berkeley-affiliated <a href="http://www.calperfs.berkeley.edu/"><u>Cal Performances</u></a>
            does bring many wonderful music, dance, and theater performances to campus like the
            Chinese National Circus and the Vienna Philharmonic, but these events are often
            prohibitively expensive for most Cal students. For example, I paid nearly $50 for a
            seat at the Yo-Yo Ma concert in one of the last rows of the second level of Zellerbach,
            and the ticket had already been discounted by 50% because I was a Cal student.
            Furthermore, no tickets are reserved for Cal students, so they often quickly sell out
            to campus outsiders, thus exacerbating the problem of accessibility to students. I
            purchased the aforementioned coveted ticket several months in advance of the concert
            date because it sold out before most Berkeley students even knew about the performance.
        </div>
        <div class="segment">5. There are many other possibilities for improvement.</div>
        <div class="text">
            There are also numerous other possibilities that would make this post far longer
            than it is now. One such idea is the argument that student organizations should be
            allowed and even encouraged to achieve non-profit status and to hold their funds in
            non-ASUC accounts. Inter-major events should also be encouraged, especially as very few
            academic organizations are broad and encompass many different fields (such as humanities
            and sciences). Perhaps more events like <a href="http://digitalhumanities.berkeley.edu/fsm-archive-hackathon"><u>HackFSM</u></a>,
            which brought together computer scientists and humanities majors to improve ways
            of conducting humanities research, would be beneficial in uniting students in different
            fields of study.
        </div>
        <div class="text">
            There are so many different wonderful ideas that it might be a good idea to invest
            in forums for students to propose and discuss ideas and solutions like <a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/"><u>Meta StackOverflow</u></a>,
            a forum to discuss improvements to the forum StackOverflow. In the end, more discussion
            and space to propose ideas may be very healthy and beneficial for our campus.
        </div>
        <div class="text">
            In conclusion, I do feel frustrated, helpless, regretful, and disillusioned. Yet at the
            same time, I feel love and hope towards UC Berkeley and towards my fellow students.
            I have honestly truly enjoyed and appreciated my time at Cal thus far, and my
            discontent ultimately stems from my firm and unchanging belief that we can do better -
            that Berkeley students deserve more and that we are capable of making our school a
            better place.
