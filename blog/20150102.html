        <div id="date">Friday, January 2, 2015</div>
        <div class="text">
            I recently finished my second year of CS. Reviewing <a href="20131227.html">my first year post</a> reminds me
            of how much has changed in this year. I decided to write another post to reflect on this past year and to
            set some future goals.
        </div>
        <div class="text">
            Being able to read my thoughts on last year brought back lots of encouraging memories. I was reminded
            of God's faithfulness demonstrated through the people and opportunities He placed in my life.
            Hopefully, this post will serve the same purpose.
        </div>
        <div class="segment">1. Last Year's Checklist</div>
        <div class="text">
            Speaking of last year, let me start off with some notes on things I had been looking forward. Some things
            happened, others were abandoned, and still others are in progress.
        </div>
        <ul class="text">
            <li>
                My family did go to CES together, and we had a wonderful time viewing new technology, listening
                to speakers, and having fun in Vegas. Of the devices, I was most enamored with Sony's
                <a href="http://store.sony.com/4k-ultra-short-throw-projector-zid27-LSPXW1S/cat-27-catid-collections-ifa">
                4K ultra short throw projector</a>, and I was thrilled to see John Chambers speak on the Internet of Things.

        <div class="pic"><img src="assets/images/20150102_1.jpg"></div>
        <div class="caption">Completely enamored with Sony's short throw projector</div>
            <li>
                Working on various side projects like the UPE website and the Web Design Decal Portal gave me
                the chance to learn a back-end framework (Django).
            </li>
            <li>
                Due to a rough spring semester, I left CSUA (Computer Science Undergraduate Association) leadership.
                (I'll explain more below.)
            </li>
            <li>
                I decided not to apply for Cal Blueprint due to time commitments. But that's okay, because I have
                plenty of side projects to work on.
            </li>
            <li>
                I still haven't fully participated in a hackathon. However, I am no longer so convinced that giving
                up my sleep would be such an enjoyable experience.
            </li>
            <li>
                I still love Java, and I am still very happy studying CS.
            </li>
            <li>
                Various challenges and opportunities have been growing my character.
            </li>
            <li>
                I've built some great new friendships, gotten to know some old friends better, and grown closer
                to my family.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <div class="segment">2. Computer Architecture, Algorithms, Real Analysis</div>
        <div class="text">
            In Spring 2014, I took CS 61C (Computer Architecture), CS 170 (Algorithms), and Math 104 (Real Analysis).
            I really enjoyed them all, and my only regret is that I was unable to dedicate the time necessary to fully
            learn the material.
        </div>
        <div class="text">
            In CS 61C, I was introduced to a variety of foundational concepts in computer architecture like virtual memory,
            caching, processors, and parallelism. The class didn't go into too much depth on any particular topic, but it
            greatly increased my general understanding of how things fit together.
        </div>
        <div class="text">
            I had bits and pieces of information in my head that didn't quite fit together as a cohesive whole. For example,
            I knew that data was represented as bits, I could write a program in a high-level language, I had a general
            notion of compilation as turning my program into bits, and I could draw simple circuit diagrams with various
            gates. But I had no idea how my high-level program - even in the form of bits - caused anything to happen in
            the processor and led to the incredible results I could see.
        </div>
        <div class="text">
            61C changed that and provided clarity on a number of different of topics. I finally saw connections between
            those pieces of information, and it made things feel even more meaningful and interesting than they already
            were. It was also inspiring to learn about brilliant ideas of both pioneering computer scientists and
            modern research scientists.
        </div>
        <div class="text">
            One of my favorite memories was when Prof. Dan Garcia announced during lecture that we were finally going to
            connect software with hardware. He dramatically displayed <i>The Creation of Adam</i> by Michelangelo and
            blasted the <i>Hallelujah Chorus</i> as students cheered.
        </div>
        <div class="pic"><img src="assets/images/20150102_2.jpg"></div>
        <div class="caption">The hand of God meets the hand of man</div>
        <div class="text">
            CS 170 was another great class. I loved learning about different algorithms, and I particularly enjoyed
            the dynamic programming section. If I could retake any class at Berkeley, this would be the class.
            We were introduced to so many cool concepts, and it would be nice to have another chance to absorb all the
            material.
        </div>
        <div class="text">
            Taking Math 104 was a bittersweet experience. On one hand, it completely changed the way I thought about math,
            and it was a stimulating learning experience. On the other hand, the rigor of real analysis was very
            difficult for me to grasp conceptually, and I think I entered the course ill-prepared to write formal proofs.
        </div>
        <div class="text">
            Before 104, I associated math with numbers and concrete facts like "the square root of 2 is irrational."
            However, I quickly realized that upper-division math is very different from the math that most students are
            exposed to starting from kindergarten. Even lower-division math in college assumes various theorems
            as given and asks students to calculate the answers to problems.
        </div>
        <div class="text">
            Real analysis was more about proving things that I had always taken for granted in my study of math. It
            started with clear definitions that made me realize that concepts in math are not necessarily matters of
            correct or incorrect, but are rather ways of defining and characterizing the world.
        </div>
        <div class="text">
            I could no longer assume that "the square root of 2 is irrational." I had to prove that it was, given some
            axioms and a well-defined field. It was insufficient to convince myself that something was correct because it
            made sense; proofs had to be constructed rigorously.
        </div>
        <div class="text">
            In short, the course was an eye-opening learning experience, but it was also something that felt insurmountable
            at times. It was a humbling experience that gave me a deep respect for math and those who study it.
        </div>
        <div class="segment">3. Overcommitment</div>
        <div class="text">
            If there was one piece of advice I could have given myself before I entered college, it would be to avoid
            over-committing. I feel like my mind uses a greedy algorithm in selecting opportunities and ways to spend my
            time and energy. This often leads to a schedule and load that is far from optimal.
        </div>
        <div class="text">
            At Berkeley, there is an endless stream of activities and possibilities. In addition to taking three challenging
            technicals in Spring 2014, I was working part-time as a web developer for the Monarch Initiative (LBNL),
            liaising with industry and the EECS department as VP Industrial Relations of the CSUA, and involved with church
            and a small-group. I was also a TA for the Web Design Decal and commuting once a week to Rosa Parks Elementary
            School to assist with a second grade math class as the field work portion of a CalTeach class I was taking.
        </div>
        <div class="text">
            This cumulative load was far too taxing. I didn't have enough time to study for my classes, leading to my
            worst academic performance in my time here at Berkeley. I additionally felt very mentally and emotionally
            drained. To make matters worse, I started having some problems with other individuals. This was the straw that
            broke the camel's back.
        </div>
        <div class="pic"><img src="assets/images/20150102_3.jpg"></div>
        <div class="caption">Why yes, I did just call myself a camel</div>
        <div class="text">
            In order to preserve my sanity and love for CS and the CS community, I decided to step down from CSUA leadership.
            Thankfully, Maajid was able to replace me, and he did a brilliant job. While I stayed active by helping with
            Startup Fair and other events, this was a much-needed relief.
        </div>
        <div class="text">
            Unfortunately, I was still overloaded, but there wasn't much I could do for the remainder of the semester but
            push on. This was one of the lowest points of my time in college, but I thankfully had the support of my family
            and some wonderful friends like Elizabeth Kim and my roommates.
        </div>
        <div class="text">
            Thankfully, I learned from this experience and realized that I needed to make wise choices to achieve balance
            in my life. Several things happened after this realization. I stopped working at LBNL due to an offer to TA for
            CS 61BL over the summer, and I made my schedule far more manageable in the next semester.
        </div>
        <div class="text">
            I ended up working at LBNL on the Monarch Initiative for roughly 8 months. I learned a lot about working on a
            long-term project as part of a large team. My bosses were very kind and intelligent people, and it was great
            to see their vision develop as the project progressed. Overall, it was an ideal experience for my first CS job.
        </div>
        <div class="segment">4. Web Design Decal</div>
        <div class="text">
            In the spring, I became a TA for the <a href="http://wdd.io/">Web Design Decal</a> (WDD). This entailed reading
            applications, grading homework, responding to emails and Piazza posts, holding office hours, and teaching
            short hands-on segments during lecture where I worked through examples of what the students were learning.
        </div>
        <div class="text">
            I enjoyed teaching and realized that I particularly liked running logistics. I was very grateful to the WDD
            instructors <a href="http://designbyroka.com/">Shawn Park</a>, <a href="http://jeffzhan.com/">Jeff Zhan</a>,
            and Kevin Liang for giving me the opportunity to join the staff. I also became friends with the other TAs
            (Adam Sebti, <a href="http://www.andyq.in/">Andy Qin</a>, <a href="http://ingridhong.com/">Ingrid Hong</a>,
            and Philip Su).
        </div>
        <div class="text">
            After the spring semester, we had some staff changes as Jeff graduated, Andy transitioned to be the
            programming instructor, and two new TAs joined the team (<a href="http://www.tomasvega.com/">Tomas Vega</a> and
            <a href="http://www.hamzaaa.com/">Hamza Ahmed</a>). My fellow staff members are all really fun, talented,
            and motivated individuals, and I'm happy to call them my WDD family.
        </div>
        <div class="text">
            We had lots of goals for the next semester, so we worked on several projects that summer. Many exciting
            developments resulted from that time. Andy secured departmental funding for a live webcast. Ingrid designed
            a cool logo for the class, and we rebranded all our lecture slides and homework materials. Shawn re-designed
            the website, and we moved to a new domain name (wdd.io) hosted on Webfaction, which generously donated free hosting.
        </div>
        <div class="pic"><img src="assets/images/20150102_4.gif"></div>
        <div class="caption">Shawn's awesome redesign adds styles to a window as users scroll past lecture topics</div>
        <div class="text">
            One of our biggest achievements that summer was creating and launching WDD Portal, a Django-based site for
            students and staff. Shawn and Tomas worked on the front-end (with Shawn additionally contributing to back-end), and
            Philip and I worked on the back-end, with Django guidance from our friend Rachit Nanda.
        </div>
        <div class="text">
            In prior offerings of the course, one of our biggest pain points was the way we collected homework
            assignments from and reported grades to students. In the first two semesters, students emailed HMTL, CSS,
            and JS/jQuery files to our email account and staff would download the files to grade them. In the first semester,
            students only found out their grade twice in the course of the semester; and in the second offering, we started
            using Canvas, a site where we added grades for students to view.
        </div>
        <div class="text">
            This workflow was quite problematic because assignments could be lost, we had to manually sort which
            staff member graded each assignment, and it took so many clicks to grade an assignment. (This inefficiency
            quickly accumulates with 100 students and ten assignments per student.)
        </div>
        <div class="text">
            One of the major features of Portal was to provide a place for students to upload their assignments. Staff
            can then click a button to open the assignment (a webpage) and enter grades and feedback on the same page.
            Portal also automatically divvies grading among the staff, ensuring that assignments are not graded multiple
            times or forgotten.
        </div>
        <div class="text">
            The site has a bunch of other useful features, like a gradebook for students and staff, attendance tracking,
            and resource hosting. We also still have a lot of improvements and features to add, so development is not yet
            finished. (I may write another post on Portal in the future.)
        </div>
        <div class="text">
            One of my favorite memories with the WDD family was our summer retreat to Santa Cruz. We rented a beautiful
            flat through Airbnb, played at the Beach Boardwalk, went shopping in Trader Joes for breakfast
            materials, and cooked the aforementioned breakfast. We ate lots of yummy food and had even more memorable
            conversations. As we bonded, we got even more excited for the next semester of teaching students.
        </div>
        <div class="pic"><img src="assets/images/20150102_5.jpg"></div>
        <div class="caption">Tomas, Hamza, Philip, Andy, Adam, me, Shawn (sadly missing Ingrid)</div>
        <div class="text">
            Some things went really well with the semester following that summer. The live webcast was well-received both by
            students who wanted to review lectures and by viewers from all over the world. One of the most exciting
            moments for the team was when we received a message from a designer in Tel Aviv, Israel, thanking us for
            helping him learn to build websites. It definitely made my day.
        </div>
        <div class="text">
            Portal likewise received lots of positive feedback along with constructive criticism and feature requests.
            It was really satisfying to see our project being used regularly by hundreds of students. And seeing how our
            users interacted with the site gave us lots of ideas for future improvement.
        </div>
        <div class="text">
            We also had a great final project presentation, where the top 12 students presented to their fellow students,
            friends, and live viewers. Shawn did a great job building an impressive judging panel of professors and industry
            developers/designers, and some of the projects blew me away.
        </div>
        <div class="text">
            This website for <a href="http://ccsdatcal.github.io/">Cross-Cultural Student Development</a> by Andrea Ikeda
            was my personal favorite. I thought she did an excellent job using the design elements in UC Berkeley's
            <a href="http://brand.berkeley.edu/colors/">branding guidelines</a> in a very clean, fastidious, and creative
            fashion. I was especially impressed by her attention to detail and design aesthetic. Additionally, Andrea is
            a true success story for WDD because as an Ethnic Studies and Gender & Women's Studies major, she came
            in with no prior web design knowledge. This makes her success all the more impressive.
        </div>
        <div class="text">
            Alongside all these wonderful occurrences, however, were some not so great things. We had an unprecedented
            number of academic dishonesty incidents, and an extremely high 20% of students did not pass the course.
        </div>
        <div class="text">
            After retrospective discussion, we realized this was because in our excitement about all the wonderful
            enhancements, we had not adequately outlined our expectations and guidelines. Many students had
            come into our class underestimating the time and energy we required. Thus, this coming semester will be a chance
            to get back to the basics and refine our policies and course material and focus on being first and foremost
            good teachers.
        </div>
        <div class="text">
            Our staff is again morphing as Hamza is transitioning to be co-design instructor alongside Shawn, and we're again
            growing with the fantastic additions of <a href="http://www.ericliang.org/">Eric Liang</a> and Jessica He. The only
            sad news is that my beloved friend Tomas will be leaving in order to focus on other passions like the connections
            between hardware and the mind. I wish him all my best; he will always be WDD family.
        </div>
        <div class="segment">5. CS 61B/L</div>
        <div class="text">
            In the summer, I got an offer from Edwin Liao (the summer instructor) to be co-head TA for
            <a href="http://www-inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61bl/su14/">CS 61BL</a>, the lab-based version of CS 61B (Data
            Structures & Programming Methodology in Java). I had wanted to TA for a EECS department class for a while now,
            so it was very exciting news. I wrote about my experiences as a <a href="20140823.html">first-time TA</a>
            in an earlier post.
        </div>
        <div class="text">
            I got rehired again for the fall semester under Profs. Paul Hilfinger and Josh Hug. It was unbelievable to TA
            for Prof. Hilfinger because he had been my professor when I took 61B. And it was great to work with Josh in his

            I recently found this photo while going through my archives. It had been sentimentally taken on the last day
            of 61B in Fall 2013 when I was a student filling out course surveys. When I took the photo, I only knew
            Prof. Hilfinger. Only now do I realize that one of the HKN candidates administering the survey was Leo Colobong,
            now one of my current fellow TAs and a good friend.

        <div class="text">
            I had lots of fun as a TA this past semester. I got the fabulous opportunity to teach the <a href="http://cs-scholars.berkeley.edu/">
            CS Scholars</a> section, and it was a real pleasure to teach such attentive and hard-working students. (I've somehow
            gotten lucky with awesome students every semester.)
        </div>
        <div class="text">
            Each semester, I also find more reasons to love teaching. This semester, I realized that teaching has been growing my
            character. There are always different challenges that teach me to respond with patience, wisdom, calmness, and
            understanding.
        </div>
        <div class="text">
            For example, I would honestly say that one of the weaker aspects of my personality is my ability to empathize with
            others and convey this empathy to them. One of my continual prayers is that God would constantly take my heart of
            stone and give me a heart of flesh as in <a href="http://esv.literalword.com/?q=ezekial+36%3A26">Ezekiel 36:26</a>.
            So one of my personal goals for teaching is to actively care about the development and well-being of my students and
            to let them know that I care about them and will be there for them.
        </div>
        <div class="text">
            When I read my anonymous feedback for Summer 2014, I was very happy that fifteen of my sixteen reviews were very
            positive. There was, however, a single negative review: "I do not think she is caring about students very much. She
            should understand some students are weaker than other students." My initial reaction was disbelief then annoyance.
            I had sincerely cared for each and every one of my students, and I was confused as to why one of them thought
            I was not caring.
        </div>
        <div class="text">
            However, I realized that I could always improve and decided to again try my best to connect with my students. This
            semester, I tried out something new. At the middle of the semester in the midst of midterms and projects, I felt
            that many students were struggling and losing hope. (The midpoint is always the hardest.) So I sent emails to all
            my students asking them how they were doing and how they felt. I asked them to tell me about anything they wished to
            talk about.
        </div>
        <div class="text">
            I was overwhelmed by the responses. So many of them emailed back giving me a little opening into their minds and lives.
            Some asked me questions like how to get into web design or if I had general tips for the projects or exams. Others
            wrote that they were happy and feeling challenged in a good way by the class. Still others wrote that they felt lost
            and didn't know how to catch up. And some of my students even told me about situations in their personal lives that
            they were struggling with.
        </div>
        <div class="text">
            I responded to each and every email, and even started some long-term conversations with students. And I thoroughly
            enjoyed it. And that's when I sort of had a breakthrough. I realized that one of the best ways to feel empathy for
            others was to get to know them. Once you know someone, you can't help but want to help them, and it becomes
            incredibly easier to understand them and their thought processes.
        </div>
        <div class="text">
            This coming fall semester will be my third time TAing for 61B, and I am co-head TA over a staff of 23 TAs
            under Prof. Josh Hug again. It should be an exciting time, as we expect enrollment of roughly 1200 students.
            We also have tons of plans to revise the curriculum and create a new website and autograder system.
        </div>
        <div class="text">
            But above all else, what I look forward to most is to meet my new students and to get to know them. I want to
            give them the best possible learning experience, and I want to also grow more in knowledge and character.

        <div class="segment">6. Operating Systems, Internet Architecture</div>
        <div class="text">
            If I were to characterize my fifth semester at Berkeley, I would call it a mind-blowing experience. Academically,
            I took a far lighter load than in past semesters in order to have time for my TA positions. However, I felt
            that I still learned and grew significantly.
        </div>
        <div class="text">
            CS 162 (Operating Systems) was an astounding class in a similar vein to CS 61C. It was far narrower in scope
            than previous classes, and I really enjoyed the deeper exploration into the material as I got a chance to
            work with concrete examples of high-level concepts.
        </div>
        <div class="text">
            For example, our first two projects involved building features in C into a mini operating system called
            <a href="http://pintos-os.org/">Pintos</a>. For our first project, we explored concurrency and scheduling by
            implementing priority scheduling of threads and priority donation from high-priority threads to blocking
            threads holding locks. It was amazing to read through the source code for the OS and see how things like
            locks, semaphores, and threads were represented.
        </div>
        <div class="text">
            Our second project gave us a better view of how the OS interacts with user programs as we implemented many
            common syscalls like exec (Pintos version of UNIX fork + exec), wait, read, write, etc. I really enjoyed
            seeing a simple view of the file system and reading an implementation of file descriptors.
        </div>
        <div class="text">
            For the third project, we implemented parts of a distributed key-value store, using 2PC (Two-Phase Commit) as
            a protocol to track and log interactions between client, master, and slave servers. It was a pretty cool project
            that gave me a deeper appreciation for far more complicated distributed systems and a curiosity about how they
            deal with consistency, availability, and partition tolerance. I no longer look at Google Docs or iCloud the
            same way.

        <div class="caption">A 2PC diagram</div>
        <div class="text">
            162 was one of my favorite classes at Berkeley, if not my favorite. I really enjoyed it because of the concepts
            that were covered, the dedicated teaching staff (Prof. David Culler & GSIs), the interesting projects, and my project
            group. I now have such a deep respect for the kernel developers of modern operating systems like Linux and OSX.
            (Sorry, Windows, but CreateProcess is not as awesome as fork + exec. Just kidding.)
        </div>
        <div class="text">
            Speaking of my project group, the three guys I worked with were lots of fun and made everything even more
            enjoyable. I was really thankful to have such a dependable and intelligent group. I learned a lot from them
            about operating systems, good programming practices, Vim, and way too much about Taylor Swift & Ellie Goulding.
        </div>
        <div class="text">
            CS 168 (Internet Architecture & Protocols) was the other technical class I took in the fall. I thought it
            complemented material from Web Design Decal and CS 162 really well. From WDD, I knew how to create web sites
            by hosting publicly-accessible files on servers. From 162, I knew about sockets in the operating
            system and server/client relationships.
        </div>
        <div class="text">
            168 material fit really well into the gap between the two, explaining how files are chunked into packets and
            sent over the Internet using protocols like TCP and IP. It was also great to see how routing protocols like
            OSPF (link-state) and RIP (distance-vector) implement graph theory algorithms discussed in 170 (Dijkstra's and
            Bellman-Ford, respectively).
        </div>
        <div class="text">
            I also really appreciated how the Internet is such an active area of research and how that research is so
            heavily impacted by practical concerns like congestion, packet loss, and datacenter networks.
        </div>
        <div class="text">
            One of the best moments of the class was when we stepped through the process of a computer connecting to a
            LAN and requesting a webpage. It was really cool to see how all the different protocols we had been learning
            about worked together to produce a result so familiar.
        </div>
        <div class="segment">7. Planning for the Next Year</div>
        <div class="text">
            This coming semester, I will be taking CS 164 (Compilers) with Prof. Hilfinger and CS 186 (Databases). I am
            really looking forward to both classes with great partners. I'll be a third-time TA for both Web Design Decal
            and CS 61B under Prof. Josh Hug.
        </div>
        <div class="text">
            I have so many hopes and dreams for this coming semester, but they can all be encapsulated as three desires:
            (1) that I would grow in knowledge and enthusiasm for CS, (2) that I would grow in character and love for God, and
            (3) that I would grow relationships with more wonderful people.
        </div>
        <div class="text">
            To those of you who are in my life, thank you. To the author of my salvation, thank you. Please continue to watch
            over me as I enter this third year of CS.
