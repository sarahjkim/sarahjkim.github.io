    I haven't written in quite a while because I've been busy this past summer teaching for
    <a href="http://www-inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61bl/su14/"><u>CS 61BL</u></a>
    (Data Structures & Programming Methodology in Java) at UC Berkeley. Now that the
    course has completed, I thought I'd share some arbitrarily chosen stories and reflections
    on my first semester as a TA. Hopefully, there will be a good mix of funny, informative,
    and thoughtful entries.
</div>
<div class="text journal">
    Interspersed with my recollections, I'll be including snippets from journal entries I
    kept for CS 375. CS 375 was an excellent pedagogy course required for computer
    science GSIs, taught by the amazing Victor Huang (veteran GSI extraordinaire).
</div>
<div class="segment">The first day of class</div>
<div class="text">
    The days leading up to the first day of class, I wracked my mind for good ice breakers.
    I asked my more experienced TA friends for suggestions, and I even looked for examples online.
    Occasionally, I would wonder to myself, "Is there even such a thing as a good ice breaker?"
    I didn't know what to do.
</div>
<div class="text">
    It turns out that 2 minutes into my first lab, I still had no idea what to do. So I did
    perhaps the lamest thing in TA history. I told me students, "I'm a libertarian. I believe
    in freedom. You all can choose whether you want to do an ice breaker or not. Just know that
    you'll be stuck in here for 12 hours each week, so it might be nice to know everybody else."
</div>
<div class="text">
    To my simultaneous dismay and relief, my students chose to do an ice breaker. Ever the
    creative person, I said, "Name, year, major, go!" while pointing to the student closest to
    me. Thankfully, my students all had wonderful personalities and went with it.
</div>
<div class="text">
    And somehow, we all ended up having a fun and lively section this summer. Either I'm a
    genius creator of ice breakers, or my students are just magical unicorns. Or both. It could
    definitely be both.
</div>
<div class="text">
    Now that school is restarting again in less than a week, I'm realizing that I still don't
    have an ice breaker. This could be problematic...
</div>
<div class="text journal">
    <div class="journal-entry">Journal entry: June 23</div>
    I forgot most of the students' names after the introductions, but I tried to ask students
    as I worked with them later one-on-one.
</div>
<div class="segment">Confusion as a teaching tactic</div>
<div class="text">
    In CS 375, we were introduced to the idea of using confusion as a teaching tactic. This
    may seem counterintuitive, but many students will engage more deeply with material if they
    are confused by it. Confusion and the subsequent struggle to make sense of a problem motivate
    learning, challenge misconceptions, and lead to longer-term retention of concepts than
    simply seeing familiar, matter-of-fact things does.
</div>
<div class="text">
    For more context on this idea, please view this interesting video on the
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVtCO84MDj8"><u>Effectiveness of Science Videos</u></a>.
    It starts off a bit slowly, but the results of field studies presented later in the video
    are quite interesting.
</div>
<div class="text">
    Throughout this semester, I have tried to utilize this tactic in my teaching. One area in
    which I applied this concept was quiz reviews. The students would take a quiz for the first
    twenty minutes of every lab section. If a significant portion of the students had
    difficulties with the quiz, I would review it the next day while addressing misconceptions.
</div>
<div class="text">
    As I graded the quizzes, I would aggregate common mistakes ranging from syntax and
    off-by-one errors to logic misunderstandings and exception-throwing code. For example, if
    I observed roughly 10 to 15 different errors, I would create two or three terrible
    "solutions" that combined all sorts of errors.
</div>
<div class="text">
    In class the next day, I would present my "solutions" and ask students if they could
    identify problems in the code snippets and suggest fixes to the code till it
    worked correctly. I think this review exercise was a helpful and engaging way of reviewing
    quiz solutions. My hope was that students would recognize their own mistakes in the
    examples and internally correct their own misconceptions.
</div>
<div class="text">
    I think debugging the code of others can help students improve their own code. And having
    to actively look for and report errors is a far more engaging activity than staring at a
    correct solution.
</div>
<div class="text">
    In the spirit of creating confusion to cause learning, I would also occasionally throw in a
    completely correct solution to check that my students were on their toes.
</div>
<div class="segment">Encouraging exploration & not knowing everything</div>
<div class="text">
    Learning is all about exploration. Something that I learned as I taught was that I didn't
    need to prove that I knew the answer to every question. And more importantly, I didn't
    need to know the answer to every question.
</div>
<div class="text">
    Being a TA is not about being a human encyclopedia or a human compiler. It's more about
    being able to guide students in the right direction and encouraging them to go off and
    explore on their own. Students don't necessarily learn and grow by memorizing facts.
    I would argue that students really improve when they figure out how to test ideas for
    themselves or when they discover resources they can reference to solve problems.
</div>
<div class="text">
    It's a gut instinct to want to immediately give an answer when asked. After all, most of
    our lives, we've been conditioned to regurgitate knowledge. But this doesn't make for the
    best teaching practice. Sometimes, it is far better to respond to a question with another
    question that guides students to form their own ideas and hypotheses.
</div>
<div class="text">
    Let's say, for example, that you're often asked questions about how a language will work.
    If you always give the answer, you will become a reference for that language, and it may
    happen that your students will eventually get to asking you questions that you don't know.
</div>
<div class="text">
    Let's say, however, that you ask your students to create tests that will answer their own
    questions by having them write code examples they could use to test how a compiler or
    interpreter will react. Helping them figure out the answers to their own questions will teach
    them the skills to figure out information on their own when you are gone. And this skill is
    arguably far more valuable than proving that you know the answer to a question.
</div>
<div class="text">
    What does this additionally mean for me? This means that there is less pressure for me to
    always give the correct answer at a moment's notice. It's okay to not know everything. If
    a student asks you a question that you don't know, it's a great opportunity to run some
    tests with him or her. Learning is all about exploration, and there is no better way to
    spend a moment of teaching than to learn with your student!
</div>
<div class="text journal">
    <div class="journal-entry">Journal entry: July 3</div>
    Today, someone asked about a tricky case (whether or not it would produce a compiler error).
    I knew the answer to that question, but I thought of something else that I didn't know the
    answer to. So I told him about that question and asked him to figure it out for me and let
    me know. I think he found it interesting, and he told me the answer to this other question.
    I think I might try that for more students that are curious about more nuanced topics.
</div>
<div class="segment">Talking about my favorite topic</div>
<div class="text">
    Those of you who have taken a look at my blog before may notice that I am seriously
    enthusiastic about Git. I am delighted to say that I contributed an excellent - if I do say
    so myself - <a href="http://www-inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61bl/r/topic/topic.html?topic=lab10.topic"><u>lab on Git</u></a>
    to the 61BL curriculum.
</div>
<div class="text">
    This lab had been several months in the making, as I had been planning
    to finish my own Git lab at some point. Some of the beginning slides may look familiar from
    my previous <a href="http://www.sarahjikim.com/blog/20131216.html"><u>post on version control</u></a>.
</div>
<div class="text">
    It was lots of fun to introduce Git to some of my students, and in later weeks, it
    warmed my heart to see students collaborating on projects using Git.
</div>
<div class="segment">Self-deprecating humor & student interaction</div>
<div class="text">
    As I taught, I was often concerned with generating student participation. This is because
    participation helps with understanding and retention of material for interacting students
    and is helpful for me to be able to focus on topics students are confused about.
    I tried out several different ideas to increase participation, some of which seemed to
    work well and others that students seemed to dislike.
</div>
<div class="text">
    One thing I tried was having students raise their hands when polled about various questions.
    For example, I might ask, "How many of you think this code will not
    compile? How many of you think this code will have runtime errors? How many of you think
    this code is fine the way it is?"
</div>
<div class="text">
    When I administered a midsemester course survey, I got some mixed results about this polling,
    which made me conclude that polling should be done strategically. Excessive polling becomes
    annoying, but it can also be nice to gauge how students think about a problem.
</div>
<div class="text">
    Something else I tried with considerable success was asking students before class began
    if they would be willing to present. When I noticed really great solutions to quizzes, I
    would request students to explain these solutions to the rest of the class. No student every
    denied this request because asking them early gave them time to prepare before sharing with
    the rest of the class.
</div>
<div class="text">
    One of my students actually mentioned these presentations in a later course survey, saying
    that being able to see fellow student solutions was actually quite helpful.
</div>
<div class="text">
    At this point, you may be wondering, "Where is the world is the self-deprecating humor?
    That's the only reason I'm reading this section!" Well, here it is. I
    tend to make stupid jokes at random times, and I have found that self-deprecating jokes
    during awkward silences seemed quite effective in guilt-tripping students into responding.
</div>
<div class="text">
    I think I definitely once said, "Please talk to me. I don't want to just talk to myself
    all day. That's embarrassing." Hey! You don't have to play fair! Guilt-trip away, my
    fellow teachers! And once you've broken through the ice and gotten a discussion going, it
    only gets easier. So get over that hill to the rolling meadows of
    not-having-to-talk-to-yourself. You won't regret it!
</div>
<div class="text">
    Finally, I've been learning that an effective way to encourage student participation
    is just to wait. It might be a bit awkward, but simply waiting for an answer or
    giving students time to come up with things to say goes a long way to increase student
    interaction.
</div>
<div class="text journal">
    <div class="journal-entry">Journal entry: July 10</div>
    Something else I noticed was that I sometimes say, "Did that make sense to everybody?"
    And I certainly don't mean it to be as condescending as it sounds. I usually remember not
    to say that, but it slips out every once in a while. So I need to practice saying things
    like, "This part might have been tricky. Are there any questions?" or "Now would be a good
    time to ask questions before we go on to the next topic."
</div>
<div class="segment">Video observations</div>
<div class="text">
    Something we were required to do for CS 375 was to record other TAs and be recorded in turn.
    This turned out to be a great opportunity to better my own teaching. There were several
    things that astonished me. Firstly, I say a "um" a ton of times. It's quite shameful if
    you're listening for it. I seem to say "um" more times than I breathe. I have been trying
    to replace the evil ums with more breathing.
</div>
<div class="text">
    Secondly, I was surprised by the fact that I looked far more nervous on camera than I had
    felt while teaching. It turns out that I have some mannerisms that indicate a restlessness
    that I never really feel when speaking. For example, I tend to move my hands when waiting
    for questions or shift my weight as I speak. The "ums" also contribute to the awkwardness.
    I have been working on appearing as calm and collected as I feel internally.
</div>
<div class="segment">Some honesty about hard times</div>
<div class="text">
    This next section is a moment of me being raw and open. So far, my stories have been mostly
    upbeat. But while there are so many great moments in teaching, there are also difficult times.
    I want to be honest about these sorts of experiences in addition to covering the good and
    interesting times because speaking about these issues may help others experiencing similarly
    tough times.
</div>
<div class="text">
    I had a difficult time about halfway through the course. We had just released midterm 1
    scores, and the last couple labs/homework assignments had been difficult for most students.
    So understandably, the mood wasn't the most cheery.
</div>
<div class="text">
    Furthermore, we had released anonymous course surveys around this point, and the feedback
    had started coming in. It is important to note that this feedback was probably affected by
    the aforementioned mood of distress. Lastly, the staff was receiving a number of
    regrade requests (more on that later), and some things happened that made my doubt my own
    abilities as a teacher.
</div>
<div class="text">
    Some of the feedback for the course and staff was far from kind. I would go so far as to
    say that some people can be quite cruel when anonymous. I completely understand the
    value of constructive criticism. Unfortunately, some of the responses we received were
    far from constructive.
</div>
<div class="text">
    It is understandable to feel frustration at a difficult course, but I would ask students
    to realize that staff are humans, too. Words can hurt us, and it can be difficult to look
    past the anger in a course evaluation to find ways to improve.
</div>
<div class="text">
    Even though none of the particularly bad evaluations were directed towards me, I still saw
    them and was both saddened and frustrated. I believe the vast majority of evaluations were
    helpful, respectful, and positive, but it can be hard to keep vitriol in perspective to
    the general student feeling. One rotten apple can spoil the whole bunch.
</div>
<div class="text">
    The evaluations made me hyper-sensitive to my own teaching, and I became overly critical
    of myself and began to wonder if I was doing a good job. As I lost confidence in myself,
    I felt increasingly drained and incapable. At this point, I'll include a quote from my
    journal at the time:
</div>
<div class="text journal">
    <div class="journal-entry">Journal entry: July 15</div>
    I guess I'm asking about how can I feel happy and motivated and energetic when I feel like
    we as staff are not being appreciated or even respected as human beings? Perhaps I'm too
    selfish and asking for too much, but it's been harder to be lively during my lectures
    (though I'm still fine communicating one-on-one with students). And I think this is making
    me a worse TA, and I'm worried that the cycle will continue to repeat. Do things get
    better or worse with time?
</div>
<div class="text">
    Thankfully, my GSI mentor/instructor Victor gave me a good dose of reality, which made me only more determined to
    become a better TA. Here are his words of wisdom below:
</div>
<div class="text journal">
    <div class="journal-entry">Victor's words: July 16</div>
    There's always going to be harsh feedback from the surveys. What you have to do is dig
    past what they actually are saying and find out what they mean. It's really hard, but you
    have to just ignore the vitriol and try to uncover the actual actionable requests
    underneath the remarks.</br>
    </br>
    Basically, when you're feeling really down because things seem hopeless, you have two
    options: you can either admit defeat and give up on the semester, which no one would blame
    you for. Or, you can internalize this feedback and use it for motivation to get even better,
    to show everyone that you can turn things around.
</div>
<div class="text">
    I decided I wasn't going to admit defeat. I was going to take what I could from the surveys
    and come back stronger. I was going to make 61BL a course that students would learn from
    and later appreciate, even if they were found it difficult and hard at the time. I was
    going to be as good a TA as possible and work even harder. So that's what I did.
</div>
<div class="segment">Only uphill from there</div>
<div class="text">
    And it got better. It really did get better with time. After I had made the determination
    to learn what I could from the criticism and just be there for my students, I was able to
    have lots of fun with them. In particular, I had lots of fun with both staff and students
    at a fantastic 61BL potluck that involved Resistance, watermelon, and Joey's wonderful
    Genmai tea.
</div>
<div class="text">
    I had a great time hanging out with students in a non-academic setting, and I was
    encouraged by all the wonderful and positive students who showed up to play with us.
    Teaching is a lot of times about finding those inspirational moments that make everything
    else worth it, and the potluck was one of those moments.
</div>
<div class="text">
    From that point on, it got better and better. I went back to enjoying teaching and having
    fun with data structures with my students.
</div>
<div class="text journal">
    <div class="journal-entry">Journal entry: July 17</div>
    The classroom climate was so much better today. I think I felt happier and more excited,
    and perhaps that mood translated to my students.
</div>
<div class="segment">Moments that make it all worth it</div>
<div class="text">
    I'm not going to lie to you. Being a TA is hard. It's a lot of work, and it may make you
    doubt yourself. But at the same time, there are moments that make it all worth it. Every
    once in a while, you'll see a student have an epiphany, and seeing the light in their eyes
    and the smile on their face will make you realize that you love teaching.
</div>
<div class="text">
    And every once in a while, you'll get a really kind email or note that makes you feel that
    you're actually helping people and that students are learning. Or you'll see that student
    using Git to commit his work. Or you'll see students you partnered together having
    fun and feel delighted that your students have become friends with each other.
</div>
<div class="text">
    And there are so many other rewarding aspects of teaching. I've learned a lot from my
    experiences in this short summer, and I wouldn't trade this summer of growth with anything.
</div>
<div class="segment">Buddy system</div>
<div class="text">
    Speaking of delightful and rewarding aspects of the course, one of the most wonderful
    things about this summer has been the incredible support I've received from the course staff.
    I feel that we all really bonded with each other, and I have been constantly inspired by my
    fellow TAs and the instructor.
</div>
<div class="text">
    One particular example is the buddy system I've had going with my fellow TA Leo. We had
    section during the same 11 AM - 2 PM time slot, and our labs were right next door to each
    other. This made it really easy to schedule lab sections and activities together. In a
    sense, our labs became "sister sections."
</div>
<div class="text">
    It started when Leo's lab came over for the midterm 2 review session. His students brought
    over chairs from next door, and we presented problems together on the projector in my lab
    room. We'd take turns explaining prompts, getting responses from students, and explaining
    solutions. I found our teaching styles to be quite complementary, and this review session
    was a huge success.
</div>
<div class="text">
    We ended up doing the final review session together later this summer, and on the last day
    of class, our sections went on a picnic on Memorial Glade, which was lots of fun. I've been
    very happy for the opportunity to teach with Leo, and I think it's been healthy
    and energizing to mix up the usual lab activities for review days.
</div>
<div class="segment">Grading tales</div>
<div class="text">
    As my stories near a close, I want to mention a bit about grading. Grading parties are both
    exhausting and tons of fun. They often last well over 12 hours.
    For example, for midterm 1, we started grading at 1 PM on Saturday and finished at 2 AM on
    Sunday. Due to the increased length of the final exam, we spread out grading for that over
    two days.
</div>
<div class="text">
    Grading parties are mentally exhausting because we must carefully examine student solutions for
    correctness, and they are physical exhausting because we usually hole up in some room in
    Soda with a supply of pizza that lasts us for both lunch and dinner.
</div>
<div class="text">
    At the same time, they are fun experiences of grading with course staff
    and telling jokes both to stay happy and telling jokes also due to delirium. When you are
    surrounded with such lively and wonderful people as the summer staff of 61BL, time flies
    and much joviality is had.
</div>
<div class="text">
    On a more serious note, however, there are a couple things to note about exam grading.
    Firstly, consistency is exceedingly important. It is a good idea to first have a look at a
    couple of student solutions then construct a rubric while getting lots of input from other
    TAs. If multiple TAs are grading one question, it is a good idea that they be able to
    discuss solutions and get second opinions from each other so that consistency is maintained
    throughout the grading process.
</div>
<div class="text">
    Secondly, almost as important as exam grading is how regrade requests are handled. It is a
    good idea to have a regrade policy that requires students to read and check the solutions
    before submitting regrade requests, and it is may be necessary to issue a disclaimer that
    grades can decrease after a regrade (according to the instructor's discretion). This
    policy helps reduce the number of requests that are submitted in error.
</div>
<div class="text">
    Thirdly, one of the most important methods for preventing incorrect regrade requests is to
    release detailed and helpful solutions. Solutions that are not explicit in terms of
    expectations and accepted answers will result in more confusion and more requests. On the other
    hand, solutions that pre-empt student questions and concerns will save you a lot of time.
</div>
<div class="segment">The last day of class</div>
<div class="text">
    As I started this post with the first day of class, it is only fitting that I end it with the
    last day of class. The last day of class was truly the opposite of the first day. Writing
    this post and re-reading my journal entries from only three short months prior makes me
    realize how much changed during the course of a short summer.
</div>
<div class="text">
    I bonded with my students, and it was quite bittersweet to see the course end. On the first
    lab day, I came up with a cringe-worthy ice breaker, but by last lab day, the section felt like
    a happy, friendly unit. My students gave me a Krispy Kreme donut and a hat, and I ate the
    former with happiness and wore the later without shame.
</div>
<div class="text">
    Some other students wrote the sweetest letters and emails, and it really touched my heart.
    I can sincerely say that I enjoyed meeting each and every one of my students, and I couldn't
    have been more lucky to have such a wonderful section for my first time as a TA.
</div>
<div class="text">
    Having completed one semester, I look forward to another. I am thankful to be working with
    many of the wonderful TAs from this summer as well as several others, and I am excited to
    experience a differently  structured <a href=http://www-inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61b/fa14/"><u>CS 61B course</u></a>
    with Prof. Paul Hilfinger and Josh Hug. And I am eagerly anticipating meeting my new
    section of students. I am sure that they are lovely and amazing and will bring with them
    a new set of tales to tell.
</div>
