    <div id="title">One Year of CS</div>
    <div id="date">Friday, December 27, 2013</div>
    <div class="text">
        A week or so ago I realized that it's been about a year since I started in
        computer science. Looking back, I am thankful for what I've learned, where I've
        come, and the world I've found. And I am so grateful to those who have helped me
        along the way. I thought I would make this introspective post to remind myself of
        this first year of CS.<br>
        Perhaps when I am struggling through projects or facing job search rejections in
        the future, I can review, remember, and refocus on why I love what I'm doing.
    </div>
    <div class="segment">1. Basic UNIX Commands</div>
    <div class="text">
        I clearly remember the day I decided to take CS 61A for fun. (I was still an
        Applied Math & Political Science major at the time.) I was sitting at my desk
        in my Foothill dorm room when I turned to my friend
        <a href="http://rogerhub.com/"><u>Roger Chen</u></a> and asked him to teach me how
        to do the cool things he did on his computer. That was the day I met my Terminal
        and the day I first experienced "delight" with CS.
    </div>
    <div id="pic1" class="pic"><img src="assets/images/20131227_1.png"></div>
    <div class="caption">Delighted with "cd" and "ls"</div>
    <div class="segment">2. Python, Scheme, Java</div>
    <div class="text">
        My first programming language was Python. You can call Python my first love.
        During winter break, my friends (Elizabeth Kim, Olivia Wung, Joshua Shu) and I
        decided to be productive by watching
        <a href="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL87898FD0A141069E"><u>CS 61A lectures</u></a>
        by John DeNero. There was much fail that break, and I don't think any of us got
        past lecture 15. But we all agreed that DeNero was wonderful and felt
        more prepared for 61A that spring.
    </div>
    <div id="pic2" class="pic"><img src="assets/images/20131227_2.png"></div>
    <div class="caption">Our pact to be productive during winter break</div>
    <div class="text">
        I learned more about Python in <a href="http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/sp13/"><u>61A</u></a>
        and soon started thinking it was the best thing
        ever. (It was at the time.) It was so easy to learn and use, and I enjoyed writing
        programs and seeing how my code could do more incredible things than I could do.
        I also learned Scheme (a dialect of Lisp) in 61A to learn about functional programming,
        and it confirmed my belief that Python was the best.
    </div>
    <div class="text">
        But while I call Python my first love, you can call Java my true love. The OOP
        section in 61A was my favorite part of the course, so it wasn't a huge surprise that
        I enjoyed Java so much in <a href="http://www-inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61b/fa13/"><u>61B</u></a>.
    </div>
    <div class="text">
        Well, to be honest, I didn't like Java all too much at first. Java, in my opinion,
        has a much steeper learning curve than Python does.
        One thing is that Python is interpreted while Java is compiled. So you can immediately
        run a Python program while you need to make sure that a Java program is written
        correctly before you can run it. Furthermore, Python is very high-level, so it allows
        you to make assumptions about things (like variable types) while Java wants these
        things to be explicit.
    </div>
    <div class="pic"><img src="assets/images/20131227_3.png"></div>
    <div class="caption">Java documentation is one of the best things about Java</div>
    <div class="text">
        However, I soon came to appreciate many of these about Java. For example, if you
        use an incorrect type, a Java program will immediately catch this as a compile time
        exception while Python might not tell you till it actually runs into an error as
        the code is executing. In fact, these days, I have difficulty with Python because
        I miss reading data structure documentation, using curly braces, and immediately
        knowing the type of a variable.
    </div>
    <div class="segment">3. Front-End Web Development</div>
    <div class="text">
        While I enjoyed building command-line programs, I was completely clueless about how
        websites were created. I wondered, "What exactly is the Internet even?" So I took
        <a href="http://thewebdesignworkshop.co/"><u>CS 198</u></a>, a
        decal on front-end web design taught by fellow Berkeley students
        <a href="http://designbyroka.com/"><u>Shawn Park</u></a>, Jeff Zhan, and Kevin Liang.
        It was a wonderful class, and I learned HTML, CSS, and front-end JavaScript/jQuery
        in an evenly-paced, structured environment.
    </div>
    <div class="text">
        I realized that I loved building the front-end of websites. So I decided to overhaul
        the CSUA's <a href="http://csua.berkeley.edu/"><u>website</u></a> for fun. And along
        the way, I learned what a website really was - files on servers accessible to public
        users. Browsers like Chrome and Firefox can interpret these files, rendering them
        as webpages.
    </div>
    <div class="pic"><img src="assets/images/20131227_4.png"></div>
    <div class="caption">My CSUA website redesign</div>
    <div class="text">
        At the conclusion of the web design decal, I built my personal website as my final
        project. This site was an exciting experience as I bought my first domain name
        on <a href="https://www.namecheap.com/"><u>Namecheap</u></a> and used GitHub's user
        pages to host the site in a <a href="https://github.com/sarahjkim/sarahjkim.github.io"><u>repository</u></a>.
    </div>
    <div class="segment">4. First CS Job</div>
    <div class="text">
        My newfound delight in front-end web development led to my first job in computer
        science. At the beginning of this month in the last week of fall semester classes,
        I started my job at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. I work with the
        <a href="http://monarchinitiative.org/"><u>Monarch Initiative</u></a> as a student
        assistant web developer/designer.<br>
        I am so thankful for this job because it pays me to spend
        time on my hobby. The hours are flexible, my bosses are great (and really cool),
        and I'm learning a lot about how to build large-scale, sustainable sites (rather
        than small sites where all the pages are designed by hand). It is also very cool
        to see examples of back-end systems and widgets (even though I'm not building them).
        I'm very excited that the beta release will hopefully be launching this coming January!
    </div>
    <div class="pic"><img src="assets/images/20131227_5.png"></div>
    <div class="caption">Page design in progress for the beta release</div>
    <div class="text">
        But I should also note at this point that I was rejected from lots of jobs before
        I got this one. I've been keeping track of my job/internship search in an Excel
        spreadsheet, and the sheet tells me that I've applied to ten companies (in addition
        to handing out my resume to many recruiters at career fairs), failed two coding
        tests, messed up in two interviews, and gotten rejected from nearly all these
        companies. I will probably continue to fail interviews and experience
        rejections. And that's okay, too!
    </div>
    <div class="segment">5. Participating In Hackathons</div>
    <div class="text">
        Something I have just started to do is participate in hackathons. Hackathons
        are industry-sponsored coding events where you can work on projects, view the cool
        hacks other students make, and stay up late with cool people (while eating food).<br>
        The first one I went to was the CSUA's Fall 2013 hackathon, and while I didn't work
        on my own project (I was working on a Hilfinger 61B project), I got to see some
        cool things other people worked on. For example, Collin Johnston and Jay Adkisson
        made a bash game, Daniel Rolandi made a game in Lua, the first place team made an
        incredible <a href="http://www.berkeleybyte.com/2013/11/23/winning-hack-solves-crossword-puzzles/">
        <u>crossword puzzle solver</u></a>, Ken Katagiri got the Pokemon theme song to play
        using a Java program (lol), and <a href="http://www.brianhou.com/"><u>Brian Hou</u></a>
        actually just played Pokemon!
    </div>
    <div id="pic6" class="pic"><img src="assets/images/20131227_6.jpg"></div>
    <div class="caption">Daniel & I with Eric and Hayg from Meraki</div>
    <div class="text">
        Another thing I did for the first time was a on-campus coding challenge. At the
        CSUA's Fall 2013 Coding for Grub, engineers from
        <a href="https://meraki.cisco.com/"><u>Meraki</u></a> made a tournament for players
        in <a href="https://github.com/sarahjkim/IteratedPrisonersDilemma"><u>iterative
        prisoner's dilemmas</u></a>. In an exceedingly strange and unpredicted
        turn of events, my partner Daniel Rolandi and I ended up winning the tournament
        (and the beautiful iPads pictured above). In all honesty, I don't think I deserved
        to win any more than the other teams in the challenge did, so the whole deal was
        quite confusing. But after this incident, I realized that maybe I could make a living
        as an engineer.
    </div>
    <div class="segment">6. Teaching Others</div>
    <div class="text">
        When I discover something cool or interesting, I feel the need to tell others.
        This is partly why I started a blog on my website (not that I find my life all
        that interesting as this post is mostly for myself). It's been a long-time dream
        of mine to teach others computer science. This is probably because of the wonderful
        experience I had with learning CS (more on that below).
    </div>
    <div class="pic"><img src="assets/images/20131227_7.png"></div>
    <div class="caption">Teaching has always been a dream of mine</div>
    <div class="text">
        However, my grades have never been quite good enough to allow me to teach others.
        Thankfully, I got the opportunity to be a TA for CS 198 this coming spring semester.
        CS 198 is the web design decal that first introduced me to front-end web dev, so
        I am really excited to share what I've learned with others. It will also be great
        to see how the course is currently run and to learn more about building effective
        lesson plans.
    </div>
    <div class="segment">7. Falling In Love With A Major</div>
    <div class="text">
        Ever since I was a little girl, I've had lots of dreams, plans, and ambition. Even
        when I didn't always know what exactly I wanted to do, I would run in some
        direction or another. This drive was largely aided by wonderful parents who decided
        to homeschool my brother and I and allowed me to have quite a bit of control over
        my own education.<br>
        But while I had motivation, I didn't have much clarity in my goals. In junior and
        senior year of high school alone, I proclaimed to my parents that I would
        become a biologist, then a lawyer, then a teacher, and then a policy analyst. I was
        one of those kids that borrowed the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/THE-BIG-BOOK-JOBS-2012-2013/dp/0071773517">
        <u>Big Book of Jobs</u></a> (complete with future projections
        by the US Bureau of Labor Statistics) and actually used the numbers to analyze my
        career options based on what I enjoyed doing and what I knew I could continue
        to enjoy doing in the future with relative financial security.<br>
        And despite the fact that I would always make these proclamations to my parents
        with conviction, I would always find things I didn't like about a chosen career path
        or change my mind when I found another interest. This to me was worrisome. I wanted
        to feel like I had a calling - a place where I fit. 
    </div>
    <div class="text">
        And then something amazing happened when I least expected it. I think God led my
        path to CS. I decided to take 61A just for fun (partly because my dad and brother were
        computer engineers, and I wanted to understand them better), and I fell in love.
        It was nearly instantaneous. When the end of the semester neared, and it came time
        to select classes for the next semester, I realized that I had poured my time and energy
        into my CS class far more than I had for classes for my actual majors. And this was
        because I enjoyed it so much. So I decided to switch.<br>
        When I was in high school, I hadn't even considered CS (despite the fact that all
        my immediate family members have technical backgrounds). I think it was expected
        by most people that I would major in the humanities and maybe find myself
        in law school. I thought programming was a dark art that was for people far cooler
        than I could ever be. (Don't laugh; I actually thought this.)<br>
        So I give credit to God for steering my path. Now that I've switched, I couldn't be happier
        and more sure that I'm finally in a major that I truly love (and one that thankfully
        has job security)! For the first time, my GPA is decreasing, but my happiness is
        increasing. I don't know what love is if it's not that.
    </div>
    <div class="segment">8. Finding A Community</div>
    <div class="text">
        Being happy with CS for me is not just about enjoying my classes. It's also about
        finding a community - a place to share knowledge, discuss interesting concepts, and
        build friendships over common interests. And thankfully, I've found people that
        are a community for me, people that I can be a community for.<br>
        When I first switched, I checked out lots of info sessions because there are an
        incredible number of CS groups at Berkeley:
        <a href="http://csua.berkeley.edu/"><u>Computer Science Undergraduate Association</u></a>,
        <a href="http://hackersatberkeley.com/"><u>Hackers@Berkeley</u></a>,
        <a href="https://hkn.eecs.berkeley.edu/"><u>Eta Kappa Nu</u></a>,
        <a href="http://upe.berkeley.edu/"><u>Upsilon Pi Epsilon</u></a>,
        <a href="http://www-inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~auwicsee/"><u>Association of Women in EECS</u></a>,
        <a href="http://swe.berkeley.edu/"><u>Society of Women Engineers</u></a>,
        <a href="http://bptech.berkeley.edu/"><u>Cal Blueprint</u></a>,
        <a href="https://tbp.berkeley.edu/"><u>Tau Beta Pi</u></a>,
        <a href="https://ieee.berkeley.edu/"><u>IEEE</u></a>, and more. Some of
        these clubs are not quite as applicable (and some are more exclusive than others),
        but there were tons of options.
    </div>
    <div class="text">
        I narrowed the list down to Hackers and the CSUA. And - quite obviously - I stuck
        with CSUA. When I first attended Hackers events, I was amazed. The people there are
        incredible, and the hacking culture is very inspirational. But I didn't feel like
        I fit in. People there were the likes of Michelle Bu,
        while I often struggled with assignments for the intro CS class. I felt lost and
        at times overwhelmed by the wealth of knowledge that was available yet strangely
        inaccessible.<br>
        And then I came to the CSUA. And there I found a relaxing, welcoming environment.
        One of the best things about the CSUA is that it's honestly for all students.
        We love hackers, we love experts, we love beginners, we love freshmen, etc.
        Everyone fits, and that made me really happy. I credit the CSUA for helping me
        immensely with my transition, and I recently joined the leadership team (Spring 2014
        VP of Industrial Relations) so that I could help others as much as I was helped
        and welcomed. I will be thankful and happy if future undergraduates find community
        with the CSUA as I did.<br>
    </div>
    <div class="pic"><img src="assets/images/20131227_8.jpg"></div>
    <div class="caption">Spring 2014 CSUA Politburo</div>
    <div class="text">
        I also met lots of incredible people through other means, like the lovely Momo Day
        crew (you know who you are) and friends in classes. I am so excited to develop
        my friendships with these wonderful people and to meet more people who continue
        to surprise and inspire.
    </div>
    <div class="segment">9. Bonding With My Family</div>
    <div class="text">
        My dad is computer systems architect (he designs the connections between software
        and hardware to bring products together at a whole), my mother majored in math
        (and took assembly language in college), and my older brother is a computer science
        major specializing in UI design at Cornell.<br>
        Thus, learning more about computer science has deepened my bonds with my family
        members. I have always thought my dad was incredible, but I am now finally able
        to understand more about what he does and how truly amazing he is. As I become
        an engineer, I have a better appreciation for my mother's sacrifice of her career
        to raise my brother and I. And I am able to talk with my brother about interesting
        CS research and ask him for advice on my classes.<br>
        CS has brought my family closer together, and I am excited that there is another
        thing now that we all have in common. In fact, we're going to
        <a href="http://www.cesweb.org/"><u>CES</u></a> together this break
        as a family, and I'm stoked!
    </div>
    <div class="segment">10. Planning for the Next Year</div>
    <div class="text">
        As I review all the crazy changes that have taken place over the course of one year,
        I've become more excited about what will come. Academically, I'll be taking CS 61C
        (Computer Architecture), CS 170 (Algorithms), and Math 104 (Real Analysis) in the
        spring. I loved the introductory algorithms in CS 70, so I'm looking forwards to
        getting a better understanding of theoretical computer science and to reading more
        research papers.<br>
        For web development, I hope to gain back-end skills. I'm planning to learn and use
        Ruby and/or Django (maybe Scala because I love Java so much). Perhaps I'll get to
        see some more interesting back-end stuff at work. And hopefully I'll try my
        hand at hacking real projects at the next hackathons.<br>
        With the CSUA, I hope to host incredible events with the rest of
        <a href="http://csua.berkeley.edu/politburo.html"><u>Politburo</u></a>
        and to develop future leaders that will continue our club's
        progress when its current leaders will have graduated.<br>
        I also hope to find more balance in my life and to prioritize my walk with God and my
        relationships with other people. And I want to keep in touch more regularly with
        my family, especially my brother.<br>

        The journey has just started. There is a lot to learn and do. But I know
        that I can continue to work hard. And more importantly, I know that others will
        continue to support me - incredible professors, smart TAs, helpful fellow students,
        driven CSUA leadership, inspiring friends, and loving family. And I know that God
        will continue to direct my life in the years ahead.<br>
        If you have supported me or taught me this past year, thank you
        so much! Please continue to watch out for me as I have much to grow. If you want
        to get more involved in the Berkeley CS community and don't know how, feel free to
        drop by the CSUA. We don't bite. And thanks for reading!
