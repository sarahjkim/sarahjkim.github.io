    <div id="title">Edward Snowden Is A Whistleblower</div>
    <div id="date">Monday, November 25, 2013</div>
    <div class="text">
        Some Americans, such as Jeffrey Toobin of the New Yorker, declare that Edward
        Snowden is "grandiose narcissist who deserves to be in prison" [1].
        He - as well as government leaders such as President Obama and various
        Senators - states that Snowden's leaks did not demonstrate true violations but
        rather only exposed government policies that "failed to meet his own standards of
        propriety" [1]. Thus, his disclosure of classified information is simply a
        crime, not a "great public service that more than outweighs any breach of trust he
        may have committed" [2]. I disagree with this view. Snowden is a
        whistleblower who did not simply dump information to hurt the United States, but
        rather revealed government abuses in such a way that the public is now able to
        propose changes and reviews that will lead to future transparency, morality, and
        reform.
    </div>
    <div class="text">
        No one can make a claim on Snowden's internal reasoning or motivations. However,
        a careful analysis of his actions and words can shed light on whether his
        information leaking falls under the Constitutional protections of free speech
        and free press or rather if it was an action worthy of prosecution.
        In particular, Snowden has been accused of disregarding the security of the
        United States and the success of its foreign diplomacy in his selfish pursuit for
        fame and acknowledgement. Yet this is clearly not the case when considering the
        content of the information that Snowden leaked as well as his method of releasing
        it. According to Glenn Greenwald, the journalist who broke Snowden's story,
        "Snowden spent months meticulously studying every document. He didn't just upload
        them to the Internet" [2]. This was not a data dump in the style of Manning.
        Snowden released only a few, extremely significant pieces of information [3].
        In fact, when Daniel Ellsberg, the famous whistleblower of the Pentagon Papers,
        was asked whether Snowden and Manning had "been discerning what they chose to
        release publicly," he responded "Yes, that's obvious with Snowden" [4]. Though
        Snowden's judgment has received some criticism when the Washington Post "decided
        to publish only four of the forty-one slides that [he] provided" because it
        thought they "should not be disseminated to the public" [1], this actually
        emphasizes his caution by obtaining a secondary judgment by credible journalists
        (rather than posting the files directly to a public site as Manning did).
    </div>
    <div class="text">
        Each document Snowden chose to reveal was directly related to the lives of
        Americans. He provided evidence on the 2015 Program, which "gets data from
        service providers like Verizon in bulk" [5], and PRISM, which "gathers data
        from Internet companies like Google, Facebook, and others" [5].
        His documents also demonstrated the adverse side-effects of federal
        laws like FAA 702, which allows the government to save "incidental data" such as
        "IPs, raw data, content, attachments" [5] that is gathered along with
        anonymous data though its collection is never specifically approved by the Federal
        Intelligence Surveillance Court. These various government projects violate the
        Fourth Amendment, which guarantees the "right of the people to be secure in their
        persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures."
        Though the government states that these projects are necessary in maintaining
        national security, Snowden's actions echo the words of founding father James
        Madison: "If Tyranny and Oppression come to this land, it will be in the guise of
        fighting a foreign enemy.... The means of defense against foreign danger
        historically have become the instruments of tyranny at home."
    </div>
    <div class="text">
        Whistleblowing is defined in the Whistleblower Protection Act as "making a
        disclosure evidencing illegal or improper government activities" [6]. Though the intelligence community is exempted from this
        protection, Snowden's disclosure does evidence an "abuse of authority" [7]
        and thus falls under the general principles of whistleblowing. In fact,
        whistleblowers from the intelligence community should be valued particularly
        because of the "absence of the governmental checks and balances...in the areas of
        national defense and international affairs" [8]. This was true during
        the time of Daniel Ellsberg and continues to be true now. An "informed and
        critical public opinion" [8] is essential to "protect the values of
        democratic government" [8], especially now that "there is a significant
        gap between what most Americans think the law allows and what the government
        secretly claims the law allows" [9]. In fact, Snowden's revelations
        provide evidence that the government is not only violating the Constitution
        without the consent of the people, but is also providing "false and misleading
        testimony...that threatens democratic control of government" [7].
    </div>
    <div class="text">
        The positive effect of Snowden's revelations is perhaps most apparent in public and
        governmental response. According to Michael German of the ACLU, in the two months
        since the disclosures, "no fewer than five lawsuits have been filed challenging
        the legality of the surveillance programs" and "over a dozen bills have been
        introduced in Congress to narrow these now public surveillance authorities and
        increase transparency" [7]. These are clearly positive changes that
        demonstrate the importance of an "informed representative government" [8]
        that can challenge "questionable activities that those in power would rather have
        kept secret" [2] and reinforce Snowden's place in history as an important
        whistleblower.
