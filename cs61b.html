                    Let's first answer the question of what the <code>Serializable</code> interface even allows
                    you to do by considering a common use case for it. Let's say that we want to create some
                    Java program that is able to maintain state across different distinct executions.
                </div>
                <div class="text">
                    One way we could achieve this effect is by saving all our important instance variables in files
                    that we read in/out of for each execution. This - while being completely doable - is, however,
                    in most simple cases made unnecessary by a built-in Java functionality called <code>Serializable</code>.
                    Any class that <code>implements</code> the <code>Serializable</code> interface can convert its
                    state into some form of information that can be saved into an output file then read back in just
                    as easily.

                <div class="text">
                    I think the best way to learn is by experimentation, so take a look at this example called
                    <a href="assets/cs61b/Main.java"><code>Main.java</code></a>, which serializes a simple
                    <code>Cat</code> class. Download it and try out the following commands.

                    $ java Main</br>
                    $ java Main Daniel

                    Perhaps at this point, you're wondering, "What in the world?! How was that possible?!" (If you're
                    not, pretend you are at this point to humor me.) Here's where you should take a look at the code to
                    see how simple it is to use <code>Serializable</code>!

                <div class="text">
                    Java is <u>pass-by-value</u>, and understanding this will help in making sense of
                    why some functions modify their parameters while others do not. I suggest
                    reading the first two answers on <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/40480/is-java-pass-by-reference-or-pass-by-value">Stack Overflow</a>.
                    Also, this comment is particularly helpful:

                    "Think about it this way. Someone has the address of Ann Arbor, MI on a
                    slip of paper called <code>annArborLocation</code>. You copy it down on a piece of
                    paper called <code>myDestination</code>. You can drive to <code>myDestination</code> and plant
                    a tree. You may have changed something about the city at that location, but
                    it doesn't change the LAT/LON that was written on either paper. You can change
                    the LAT/LON on <code>myDestination</code> but it doesn't change <code>annArborLocation</code>."

                <div class="resourcetitle">Q: Why can't I access a variable outside of the loop it was created in?</div>
                <div class="text">
                    All variables created inside a loop will be lost once the program exits
                    the loop. This phenomenon is best explained by <u>variable scope</u> in Java.
                    A local variable has a scope that limits it within the class, method,
                    and loop (if applicable) it was declared in. The local scope of a variable
                    is limited by the smallest scope that applies to it.
                </div>
                <div class="text">
                    Scope is important because <i>variables can only be used within their
                    scope</i>. Let's work through some examples. Firstly, if a variable is
                    defined within a class but outside of any methods or loops, it can be
                    accessed throughout the class.
                </div>
                <div class="text">
                    Secondly, if a variable is defined within a class method but outside of
                    any loops, it exists throughout the whole method (after it was initialized),
                    but other methods do not have direct access to the variable. (The variable
                    being passed into another method as a parameter does not count because
                    Java is pass-by-value. If you have questions about this comment, reference
                    the question above.)
                </div>
                <div class="text">
                    Finally, we get to the loop example. If a variable has been created
                    within a loop, its most limiting scope is the loop. Thus, it can only
                    be used within the loop. I thought <a href="http://www.java-made-easy.com/variable-scope.html">this page</a>
                    was a helpful read on variable scope.
